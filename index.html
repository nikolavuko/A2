    <h1 class="banner-title">HISTORY OF MEN'S TENNIS</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
        Since the beginning of the open era (1968), tennis has exploded in popularity as a televised sport and competition. 
        Today we will dive into the history of the men's side of tennis, seeing what countries have had the most success, 
        the diversity of the surfaces on tour, and delving deeper into the infamous “Big 3”.

            In the open tour, different tournaments have different worth, ranging from tournaments that 
            are worth 250 points all the way to the most pristine “Grand Slams”, worth 2000 points. 
            When looking into the history of a player's career, all wins are important, but the Grand Slams are what is looked at the most.

            Tennis is an international sport, with the tour being all over the world, hence players from all over the globe compete. From this map we can see which countries have had the most success this century. Some countries such as America have their wins come from a range of players, whilst others such as Serbia only come from a handful of players. Now we will look into the 3 players who have found the most success in the sports history.

<!-- Big 3 Title and Introduction -->
<h1 class="banner-subtitle">THE <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.3em;">BIG 3</span> </h1>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
    Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic are considered the Big 3 of tennis, but why is that? 
    In a sport with so many great players, what makes these three stand apart? Well, for over a decade, 
    they dominated the sport, consistently in the top rankings and winning the most slams. This year is the 
    first since 2002 that a single member of the Big 3 has not won a grand slam—22 years of dominance.

        <div class="text-section">
            <p>
                Roger was first to the scene and found the most success early on, while Djokovic was the last to peak 
                and has continued success to this day, winning a gold medal in this year's Olympic Games.

             Each player had a preferred surface. With Nadal being the most dominant on clay, he earned the name 
             “The King of Clay”. Nadal's dominance in the French Open will likely never be topped. Djokovic's 
             well-roundedness is likely why he has the most slams of the three.

             With Nadal announcing his retirement, this will be what the final head-to-head of the Big 3 looks like. 
             It can be seen that Djokovic finished with a positive win rate against the other two. Djokovic and Nadal 
             had the greatest rivalry in all of tennis, with 60 matches played between them. They share records such 
             as the longest Australian Open final (5 hours and 53 minutes) and most matches played against the same opponent.
